Created engine/src/render/particles.rs with GpuParticle (32 bytes), Particle, ParticleUniforms, and ParticleSystem structs. System supports spawning up to 1024 particles with GPU instancing. Particles float upward with random drift and fade out over 2-4 seconds. Additive blending (SrcAlpha/One) creates glow effect. Tests included. Pre-existing errors in building_physics.rs are unrelated to this story.",
