# What We DON'T Want

## Gameplay
- **NO micromanagement**: Workers should be AI-controlled, not manually assigned
- **NO complex economy**: Keep resource system simple
- **NO excessive unit types**: Focus on quality over quantity

## Technical
- **NO heavy dependencies**: Keep the dependency tree minimal
- **NO external game engines**: Custom Rust engine only
- **NO networking (initially)**: Focus on single-player and local multiplayer first
